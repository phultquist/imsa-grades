                This site was made for students, parents, teachers and all other community members to have clean and
                    consistent access to grades at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy. 2012-2017 Data was aquired
                    through a 2017 FOIA Request by a Class of 2018 student. Data from 2016-2020 was gathered from the Office of Institutional Research, but only 2018-2020 data was used.<br><br><i>Note this is not an official site. If you find an error, please report it.</i>
